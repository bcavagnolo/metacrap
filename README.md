Project description:
	We imagined a meta-utopia where we don't penalize people for merely misspelling. "People are Lazy!". MapCrap to the rescue. 
Similar to the misspelled listings on eBay that Cory Doctrow talks about , when people are allowed to tag places on a map , 
they often misspell.So we wanna be able to retrieve places with tags that were spelled - 'restrant' rather than 'restaurant'. 
Our search results do exactly that. We do not impose any restrictionson on how the tags are spelt when they are created. 
But we make sure that even the misspelled tags show up in the search results.  Problem solved! Nobel prize please!
